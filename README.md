# Pi Network
Pi is a new cryptocurrency for and by everyday people that you can “mine” (or earn) from your phone.
Pi is not a scam. It is a genuine effort by a team of Stanford graduates to give everyday people greater access to cryptocurrency.
You do not need to leave the app open to mine. Pi does not affect your phone’s performance, drain your battery, or use your network data . Once you hit the lightning button, you can even close the app and you will continue to mine Pi.
